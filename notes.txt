#to do 
#add all these 10 colleges names in keyword classes
#add and create files with paths and other files according to name
# COMPLETE CSV :-  faculty_dept_course
# remove tokens from rulebase
# create one doc for eigibility (prerequisites) synonym  ,syllabus and duration 



this method will take keyword classes set as input and if the tokens(keywords in the set is euql to the elements in the set generated after spluting the rule_format string then the best mathed rule will be returned
